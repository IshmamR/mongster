# Roadmap

## ‚úÖ Completed (v0.0.1)

### Core Schema System
- [x] Schema definition with `createSchema()`
- [x] Rich type system (primitives, arrays, nested documents, unions)
- [x] Type inference engine (`InferInputType`, `InferDocumentType`)
- [x] Nested document support with subdocument arrays
- [x] Union types with proper TypeScript inference
- [x] Field options (required, nullable, default values)

### Query System
- [x] Model creation with `createModel()`
- [x] Chainable query API (`.find()`, `.findOne()`)
- [x] Type-safe filtering with MongoDB operators
- [x] Sorting with nested path support (`.sort()`)
- [x] Field projection with type inference (`.project()`)
- [x] Pagination (`.limit()`, `.skip()`)
- [x] Nested path queries (`"address.city"`)
- [x] Query execution (`.exec()`)

### MongoDB Integration
- [x] Connection management with `createConnection()`
- [x] Official MongoDB driver integration
- [x] Collection operations with proper typing

- [ ] Comprehensive benchmarking suite

### Community & Integrations
- [ ] Plugin system for extensibility
- [ ] Integration with validation libraries (Zod, Yup)
- [ ] ORM-style relationships (opt-in)
- [ ] GraphQL schema generation

## üìù Notes

### Type System Constraints
- Recursive types are limited to depth 3-5 to maintain compilation performance
- Complex union types may require manual type assertions in edge cases
- Template literal types for nested paths have inherent TypeScript limits

### MongoDB Driver Compatibility
- Built on MongoDB Node.js driver v6.x
- Supports MongoDB 4.4+ features
- Maintains compatibility with official driver APIs

### Breaking Changes Policy
- Pre-1.0: Breaking changes allowed with clear migration guides
- Post-1.0: Semantic versioning with deprecated feature warnings
- Focus on compile-time detection of breaking changes

### Performance Targets
- Sub-1ms query building overhead
- Minimal runtime type checking
- Efficient memory usage for large schemas
- Fast TypeScript compilation even with complex schemas
